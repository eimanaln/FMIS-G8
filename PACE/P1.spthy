// 1- Decalre the name of the theory and start modeling 
theory FirstExample
begin

// 2- declare the crypto primitives 
builtins: hashing, asymmetric-encryption

// 3- Modeling public key Infrastructure 

// Registering a public key
// means generate a random value for the private key ltk and like it to the agent A 
//  pk(~ltk) is the public key of A
rule Register_pk:
    [ Fr(~ltk) ]
  -->
    [ !Ltk($A, ~ltk), !Pk($A, pk(~ltk)) ]

// allows any adversary to retreive any public key using this function 
// it reads a public-key database entry and sends the public key to 
// the network using the built-in fact Out
rule Get_pk:
    [ !Pk(A, pubkey) ]
  -->
    [ Out(pubkey) ]


// model the dynamic compromise of long-term private keys using the following rule. 
// Intuitively, it reads a private-key database entry and sends it to the adversary
// rule has an observable LtkReveal action stating that the long-term key of agent A 
//was compromised.
rule Reveal_ltk:
    [ !Ltk(A, ltk) ]
  --[ LtkReveal(A) ]->
    [ Out(ltk) ]


// 4 - modeling the protocol 

// Start a new thread executing the client role, choosing the server
// non-deterministically.
rule Client_1:
    [ Fr(~k)         // choose fresh key
    , !Pk($S, pkS)   // lookup public-key of server
    ]
  -->
    [ Client_1( $S, ~k )    // Store server and key for next step of thread
    , Out( aenc(~k, pkS) )  // Send the encrypted session key to the server
    ]

rule Client_2:
    [ Client_1(S, k)   // Retrieve server and session key from previous step
    , In( h(k) )       // Receive hashed session key from network
    ]
  --[ SessKeyC( S, k ) ]-> // State that the session key 'k'
    []                     // was setup with server 'S'

// A server thread answering in one-step to a session-key setup request from
// some client.
rule Serv_1:
    [ !Ltk($S, ~ltkS)                             // lookup the private-key
    , In( request )                               // receive a request
    ]
  --[ AnswerRequest($S, adec(request, ~ltkS)) ]-> // Explanation below
    [ Out( h(adec(request, ~ltkS)) ) ]            // Return the hash of the
                                                  // decrypted request.
